# dataset

creditcard.csv is the name of dataset contains 28columns and you can find the detialed description of the datset in the above code file

# Implementation and algorithms

I used many machine learning algorithms were we cna find the explaintation and all the changes and preprcessing part in the ipynb file
and RandomForest produces the best fitted algorithm
